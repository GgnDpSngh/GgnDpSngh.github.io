I will be starting as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) from Fall 2021. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and programming languages. My long term goal is to design end-to-end automated formal reasoning tools for real-world systems with both software and AI components such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and AI-powered healthcare devices. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020, where I worked on designing scalable and precise automated reasoning tools for programs and deep neural networks. I have developed two state-of-the-art tools [ELINA](https://github.com/eth-sri/ELINA) and [ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran), for program analysis and neural network verification, respectively. Both were developed from scratch and are popular in both Industry and Academia. ERAN recently verified the highest number of benchmarks at [VNN-COMP'20](https://sites.google.com/view/vnn20/vnncomp). Previously, I completed a Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012. I have received the ETH Medal for best Master thesis and the President of India Gold Medal for being the best student at IIT Patna.

I am looking for prospective Ph.D. students to work with me on the exciting topics above.
