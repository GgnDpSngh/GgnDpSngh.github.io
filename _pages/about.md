I will be starting as a Tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) from Fall 2021. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and programming languages. My long term goal is to design end-to-end automated formal reasoning tools for real-world systems with both software and artificial components such as autonomous vehicles, robots, and AI-powered healthcare devices. I obtained PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich in 2020 where I worked on designing scalable and precise automated reasoning tools for programs and neural networks. Before that, I completed Masters in Computer Science at ETH in 2014 and Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Patna in 2012. I have received ETH Medal for best Master thesis and President of India Gold Medal for being the best student at IIT Patna.
